  <p>This tool is to approximate the year of a Squier guitar. This tool in no way validates that a guitar is in fact a Squier. Also due to the use of third party data some dates might be missing. For instance as of 2017.02.22 most serial numbers past 2011 are not included. I am working on adding the most recent years.</p>
